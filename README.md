Estimating the number of vehicles in a traffic video sequence is an essential component in intelligent transportation systems (ITS),
which provides valuable traffic flow information. The number of vehicles on the road reflects traffic conditions, such as traffic status, 
lane occupancy, and congestion levels, which can be utilized for accident warnings, congestion prevention, and automatic navigation.



The detection of vehicle objects is the first step in obtaining traffic flow information. 
The purpose of object detection is to obtain the location and classification of the object from an image. 
Its primary task is to acquire the features of the object. It exhibits better performance if the object has some deformation or scale change.



Traffic management has become an important daily routine in cities today with the exponential growth of traffic on roads.
Automatic vehicle detection from traffic scenes and extracting essential parameters related to vehicular traffic can help better management of traffic on busy highways and road intersections.
Monitoring traffic flow and estimating traffic parameters can be carried out using image processing techniques. 

Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. 
The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods.
